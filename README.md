Contacts App (API-Based)

This project is a simple contacts app made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was built to help learn how APIs work and how to use JavaScript to get, add, edit, and delete data.

The app connects to an API to load contacts and show them on the page. Users can refresh the list, add new contacts using a form, edit existing contacts, and delete contacts from the database. JavaScript Fetch and FormData are used to send and receive data.

Each lesson builds step by step, starting with setting up the app and API key, then learning how to work with JSON data, forms, and contact IDs.
